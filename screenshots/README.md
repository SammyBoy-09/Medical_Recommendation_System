## How to Add Screenshots to Your README

To complete the README with actual screenshots, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate through your application and take screenshots:

1. **Home Page**: Go to http://localhost:5000 and take a screenshot
2. **Symptom Prediction Page**: Click on "Symptom Prediction" or navigate to the symptom input page
3. **Results Page**: Enter some symptoms and view the results page
4. **About Page**: Navigate to the About section
5. **Developer Page**: Navigate to the Developer section

### 2. Save screenshots in the screenshots folder:

Save each screenshot in the `screenshots/` folder with the following names:
- `home-page.png`
- `symptom-prediction.png`
- `results-page.png`
- `about-page.png`
- `developer-page.png`

### 3. Screenshot Guidelines:

- Use PNG format for better quality
- Take full-page screenshots or crop to show the relevant content
- Ensure the screenshots are clear and readable
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 1MB each)
- Use consistent dimensions if possible

### 4. After adding screenshots:

1. Commit the changes to git:
   ```bash
   git add screenshots/
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add screenshots to README"
   git push
   ```

2. Your GitHub repository will now display the screenshots in the README!

### Alternative: Using GitHub Issues for Screenshots

If you prefer, you can also:
1. Create a GitHub issue
2. Drag and drop screenshots into the issue
3. Copy the generated URLs
4. Use those URLs in your README instead of local files
